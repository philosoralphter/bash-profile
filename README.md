# Bash-Profile and Shell Setup Tools

Scripts to run once (or maybe in bashrc) to setup a machine

/src-this is a folder of compartmentalized bash profile settings. they are meant to be pulled into ~/.bash_profile via `source` commands

Rough around the edges for now.  May attempt to make more generally useful.
